The python notebook is uploaded with output.

k-Times Markov Sampling Algorithm is implemented under "markov_sampl" function.
Comments outlining different steps of algorithm are included with code.
Linear, RBF, Polynomial, Hellinger, CHi Squared and Intersection SVM Kernels are implemented both with and without k Times Markov Sampling for comparision.

The output is better than Simple Markov Sampling for every kernel than in Assignment 3.

Markov Sampling Algorithm is taken from 
Zou, Bin, et al. "$ k $-Times Markov Sampling for SVMC." IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems 29.4 (2017): 1328-1341.
