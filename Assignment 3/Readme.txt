The python notebook is uploaded with output.

Markov Sampling Algorithm is implemented under "markov_sampl" function.
Comments outlining different steps of algorithm are included with code.
Linear, RBF, Polynomial, Hellinger, CHi Squared and Intersection SVM Kernels are implemented both with and without Markov Sampling for comparision.

Markov Sampling Algorithm is taken from 
Xu, Jie, et al. "The generalization ability of SVM classification based on Markov sampling." IEEE transactions on cybernetics 45.6 (2014): 1169-1179.
